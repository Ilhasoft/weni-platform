## About

[Weni Platform](https://weni.ai) is an open-source product that contemplates a set of tools, including state-of-the-art of AI models, that enable and potentialize individuals and organizations to solve communication problems and generate impact at scale by building their own automation in a visual and low-code web platform.

As a company we're running as a SaaS product with plans based on the communication traffic necessary for the organization that's accessible in this [address](https://dash.weni.ai).

## Open-Source Governance

The Weni Platform open source projects are governed by [@weni-ai](https://github.com/weni-ai/). Weni opens all its software parts under terms of an open-source license to reach potential users and partners mainly. Secondly, Weni wants to reach developers by building a community for some pieces that are more reusable in other businesses or software projects, such as NLP models or tools. Besides that, the openness of our software is also related to building trust by enabling our external stakeholders to audit the security of our software.

## Modules

Weni Platform contemplates a set of modules with its own micro-services and micro front-ends applications to enable its whole functionalities, each one has a specific repository with its own instructions in how-to-deploy, the table below details them by using the symbol üñ•Ô∏è  for front-end components, ‚öôÔ∏è for back-end components that contain businesses rules and üß© for micro-services that are used internally for a specific task.
