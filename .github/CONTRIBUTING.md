## What is this?

These guidelines help contributors to our projects understand our workflow and
how to contribute to our projects. Following these guidelines helps communicate
that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open
source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing
your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Contribute what?

There are different ways to contribute to a project. Some ways to contribute
areâ€¦

* Writing code
* Submitting bug reports / feature requests
* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials / blog posts


## Ground rules

These ground rules are the basic responsibilities for contributing to the
project.

* **DO's**
    * DO run unit tests before submitting a pull request
    * DO create issues first for major changes / enhancements you want to make
        * Discuss things transparently first and get community feedback
    * DO keep each pull request to _one_ feature / bug fix
        * If you want to submit multiple things, submit multiple pull requests
    * DO write unit tests for new features
    * DO write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* **DON'Ts**
    * DON'T commit changes to files irrelevant to your pull request (e.g.
	  `gitignore`)


## Getting started

_Hint_:  **Working on your first pull request?** Learn how from this _free_
series. [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) 

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account.
2. Create changes in your fork.
    * Run unit tests once you're done!
3. Send a pull request to our repo.


## Report a bug

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

**Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
1. If it was reported you can contribute leaving a comment.
2. If it wasn't you can create a new issue using the label `bug`.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experienced the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported.
